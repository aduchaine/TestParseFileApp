Debug and Error logging setup:

Outside of requiring 3rd party libraries noted below, the system should be 100% autonomous.
It can be placed into another C++ project (maybe VS2013 required?) and be usable immediately after following the directions below.

1) 3rd party libraries are required for directory setup - boost::filesystem
	- these can be omitted but, the full path must be known to create and use the logging system
		- these can overwrite what is currently located in logging.h at "LogDirectories"
	- if used, their notations must be completed to use
		- see the include in logging.cpp for specifics

2)	set a root folder name
	- location isn't important as long as it remains with the program it was implemented into and the folder name can be found along the "current working directory" path
	- "root_foldername" is set in logging.h
	
3) default directory endpoints are provided but others may be created along with other log categories
	- these are located in logging.h
	- if these values are changed, they must also be changed within the source file, logging.cpp - they are not hard to find

4) #include "Logging\logging.h" or the full path to any source file needing usage

5) declare "Logging Log;" in main or the source file if individual access is only needed

5) other notes:
	- file log writing is off except for error logs
	- there are only a few class variables, conflicts are possible but unlikely
	- class accessibility is setup as an extern
	- access is attained with "Log."
